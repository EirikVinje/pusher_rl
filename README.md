# Pusher_reinforcement_learning
This repository holds the code for the reinforcement learning project. The environment used is from gymnasium, called pusher. 

“Pusher” is a multi-jointed robot arm which is very similar to that of a human. The goal is to move a target cylinder (called object) to a goal position using the robot’s end effector (called fingertip). The robot consists of shoulder, elbow, forearm, and wrist joints.
